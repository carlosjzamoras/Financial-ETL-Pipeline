Financial ETL Pipeline 
I am taking 2024 financial data for the Fortune 500 companies ultilizing Yahoo Finance's api. 
The Jupyter notebook outlines the ETL pipeline. Extracting the data from Yahoo Finance's API, transforming the data to a usable format and the loading the data into looker studio to make a dashboard. 

The final dashboard is shown below.
